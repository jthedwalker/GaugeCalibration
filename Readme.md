# Gauge Calibration

This application was designed in house to track the calibration and inspection of gauges and other calibrated equipment. 

## Requirements

1. Facilitate the entry of gauges and equipment.
2. Implement functionality for user comments on a individual asset basis.

## Project Status

The project is in the first initial release. Testing from the user base will be required to validate the design concept and usability.

## Design Concept

This application was created as an alternative to a SharePoint page used to track inspections and the status of gauges as well as other calibrated equipment.

Ease of use and simple application maintenance were a primary focus when developing the application. The intent was to create an application that allowed users to process inspections quickly while providing the user a brief overview of the asset. As the application is being used in house by a small userbase, over-posting was not a concern, as such property binding was not implemented. 

### System Requirements
